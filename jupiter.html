<h1>Jupiter</h1>
<p class="intro">
    Jupiter is more than twice as massive than the other planets of 
    our solar system combined. The giant planet's Great Red spot is a centuries-old storm bigger than Earth.

    Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei 
    found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.

<h3>Jupiter facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eleven Earths could fit across Jupiter’s equator. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.</li>
<li>Jupiter orbits about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers) or 5.2 Astronomical Units (AU) from our Sun (Earth is one AU from the Sun).</li>
<li>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year)</li>
<li>Jupiter is a gas giant and so lacks an Earth-like surface. If it has a solid inner core at all, it’s likely only about the size of Earth.</li>
<li>Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</li>
<li>Jupiter has more than 75 moons.</li>
<li>Nine spacecraft have visited Jupiter. Seven flew by and two have orbited the gas giant. Juno, the most recent, arrived at Jupiter in 2016.</li>
<li>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that’s about twice the size of Earth and has raged for over a century.</li>
