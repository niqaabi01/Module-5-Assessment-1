<h1>Uranus</h1>
<p class="intro">
    Uranus—seventh planet from the Sun—rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.
</p>

<p>
    The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, 
    although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.
